## 💡 Tips & Gotchas

- Always register Hive adapters before opening boxes to avoid typeId errors
- Define either `home` or `initialRoute` with proper routes to prevent Navigator route errors
- Handle network image exceptions gracefully to avoid crashes on missing album art
- Use `pushReplacementNamed` for custom back navigation when overriding back button behavior
